# Intent

Intent is used as a decoration on top of components. It adds universal styles (color, background color, etc...) into the components it decorates.

Five intents are defined currently.

- `Intent.NONE`, or `none`: No intent.
- `Intent.PRIMARY`, or `primary`: Primary.
- `Intent.SUCCESS` or `success`: Success.
- `Intent.WARNING`, or `warning`: Warning.
- `Intent.DANGER`, or `danger`: Danger.

Intent can be referenced in components by strings, or by Intent object.
