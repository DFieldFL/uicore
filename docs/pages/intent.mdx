# Intent

Intent is used as a decoration on top of components. It adds universal styles (color, background color, etc...) into the components it decorates.

Five intents are defined currently.

- "none", or Intent.NONE: No intent.
- "primary", or Intent.PRIMARY: Primary.
- "success", or Intent.SUCCESS: Success.
- "warning", or Intent.WARNING: Warning.
- "danger", or Intent.DANGER: Danger.

Intent can be referenced in components by enum strings, or by Intent object.
