# Link

`<Link/>` component aims to make sure the look and feel of all the links in UI are the same. This is why we implement our own instead of using `<Link/>` component from React Router, or `<AnchorButton/>` from Blueprint.

One improvement we added into `<Link/>` component is that by default it adds `rel='noreferrer noopener'` when `target` is set to `_blank`. This makes sure we don't have the [target blank security issue](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-no-target-blank.md).

When a link is disabled, all events are ignored.
