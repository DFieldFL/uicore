## Font Family

[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?selection.family=Nunito) is Harness default text font. This font is applied to document so in theory, your component should have it by default. In case when it's not the case (such as a third-party component you rely on has a different font), you can use `--font-family` variable in your CSS.
