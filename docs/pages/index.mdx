# Introduction

This project is a realization of [Next Generation UI Architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oe_cHcDyYhwjJ6QZqyOIlpUWGgYyeCIBfUOdElg2rBg/edit#heading=h.41cp29fl3vvn), plus its integrated playable documentation.

# Setup

All third-parties are defined as peer dependencies and not bundled into build output. Consumers of this toolkit need to add by themselves.

This toolkit relies heavily on Blueprint. When using it as a dependency in your project, you'll need to add Blueprint as a dependency and import two CSS files.

```js
// Import in a .js(x)/.ts(x) file
import '@blueprintjs/core/lib/css/blueprint.css'
import 'ui-platform/dist/index.css'
```

```css
/* Import from a .css file  */
@import '@blueprintjs/core/lib/css/blueprint.css';
@import 'ui-platform';
```

You also need to import [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?selection.family=Nunito) font. This font is currently used as Harness standard font.
